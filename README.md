Cat-Dog Classifier CV Model

## Overview
Welcome to the Cat-Dog Classifier CV Model project! This repository contains the implementation of 
a computer vision model designed to classify images as either a cat or a dog. 
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for effective image classification.

## Key Features
- Image Classification: Implemented a CNN-based model for accurate classification of images into two classes: cat and dog.

- Data Preprocessing: Carefully prepared and augmented the dataset to enhance the model's ability to generalize to various cat and dog images.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Utilized transfer learning techniques and trained the model on a pre-trained architecture for improved performance. The model's accuracy and other relevant metrics are rigorously evaluated.

- Interactive Web Interface: Developed a simple web interface for users to upload images and get real-time predictions from the trained model.

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the labeled cat and dog image dataset.

- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- src/: Python scripts for the implementation of the image classification model.

- web_interface/: Code for the interactive web interface for model predictions.
